Description: Provides an interface to Big Binary Indexed Wig and Bed files
	     BigWig or BigBed. These files are used to store details of genomic
	     or epigenomic features like CHIP-seq as part of the Encode project.
	     This package provides C-classes that parse these files, along with
	     an Rcpp based interface to those classes.
